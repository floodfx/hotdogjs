# ðŸŒ­ hotdogjs

What goes well with Bun?  Hotdogjs of course!  (Don't forget the mustard!)

Hotdogjs is a server-side front-end framework built specifically for [Bun](https://bun.sh).  Hotdogjs supports both server rendering and client intefactivity in a single programming model that is a departure from the decade old Single Page Application (SPA) model popularized by React.  Hotdogjs is built on the following principles:
 * **Server-side rendering** - HTML is rendered on the server and sent to the client
 * **Client-side interactivity** - client-side interactivity is achieved by sending client-events to the server, updating the server state, and repling with diffs to the client which updates the DOM which results in very small payloads in both directions, resulting in a much faster user experience
 * **No client-side routing** - we use the browser's native routing along server-side routing to determine the page to render
 * **No client-side state management** - state is managed on the server so there is no need for a client-side state management library or synchronization which is a common source of complexity, slowness, and bugs
 * **No client-side data fetching** - data is always fetched on the server and applied to the state there which is faster and more secure (no need to expose APIs to the client or worry about CORS)
 * **No virtual DOM** - on the server-side, we only consider parts of the DOM tree that can change, calculate the diffs, and send the diffs to the client which updates the DOM which results in very small
 * **No JSX** - no JSX transpiling or runtime, instead we use tagged template literals to render HTML and calculate diffs
 * **No Typescript compilation** - TypeScript is executed directly by Bun

## How is Hotdogjs different from other frameworks?
 * Built specifically to take advantage of [Bun](https://bun.sh)
 * Not an Single Page Application (SPA) framework which means:
    * No client side routing - we use the browser's native routing
    * No client side state management - state is managed on the server
    * No client side data fetching - data is always fetched on the server and either rendered in the HTML or passed via diffs to the client
    * No virtual DOM - we use the native DOM and only morph the elements that have changed since last state change
    * Page loads are extremely fast - no need to download a large JavaScript bundle
    * No JSX - only HTML and TypeScript, no JSX transpiling
    * No Typescript compilation - TypeScript is executed directly by Bun

## Why Bun?
Bun is fast as heck and, while is compatable with nodejs APIs, it offers Bun specific APIs that are orders of magnitude faster than other runtimes.  This project seeks to take advantage of Bun in its entirety.   Bun builds, bundles, transpiles, etc without dependencies on any other tools which is extremely attractive. Specific list of great things about Bun for Hotdogjs:
 * Bun [directly executes TypeScript](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/typescript#running-ts-files) without transpiling
 * 
 * and more!

## Why should you use Hotdogjs?

## Why should you NOT use Hotdogjs?
 * Hotdogjs is not ideal for static sites. It requires a server to run 



To install dependencies:
